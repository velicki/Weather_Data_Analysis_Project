# WHAT I HAVE LEARNED


Working on the Weather Data Analysis Project has been a valuable learning experience, providing me with insights and skills in several key areas:


## Data Handling with Pandas

- Reading Data: I learned how to import CSV files into Pandas DataFrames, a fundamental step in data analysis.

- Data Cleaning: I gained experience in handling missing values, detecting and dealing with outliers, and ensuring data quality.

- Data Manipulation: I enhanced my skills in transforming and organizing data using Pandas, including filtering, grouping, and merging DataFrames.


## Statistical Analysis

- Summary Statistics: I practiced computing basic statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation to understand the central tendencies and variability of the data.

- Trend Analysis: I learned how to identify and interpret trends in weather data, providing insights into patterns over time.


## Problem-Solving and Debugging

- Error Handling: I improved my ability to debug code and handle errors effectively, ensuring the robustness of my data analysis process.

- Logical Thinking: I developed stronger logical thinking skills by breaking down complex data analysis tasks into manageable steps.


Overall, this project has significantly enhanced my data analysis capabilities, deepened my understanding of Python and Pandas, and provided practical experience in managing and analyzing real-world data.
